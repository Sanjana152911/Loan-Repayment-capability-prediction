    <h2>House Loans (Mortgages):</h2>
    <p>House loans, also known as mortgages, are loans specifically designed to help individuals or families purchase a home. These loans typically involve a large amount of money borrowed from a lender, which is then repaid over an extended period, often several decades. House loans may have fixed or adjustable interest rates and require collateral, usually the property itself, until the loan is fully repaid.</p>

    <h2>Gold Loans:</h2>
    <p>Gold loans are secured loans where gold jewelry or ornaments are pledged as collateral to obtain funds from a lender. Gold loans are popular among individuals who require immediate funds but may not have access to traditional forms of credit or may not meet the eligibility criteria for unsecured loans.</p>

    <h2>Car Loans:</h2>
    <p>Car loans are loans specifically designed to finance the purchase of a vehicle, such as a car, motorcycle, or truck. These loans allow individuals to spread the cost of purchasing a vehicle over time, rather than paying the entire amount upfront. Car loans typically involve fixed monthly payments over a specified term, usually ranging from a few years to several years.</p>

    <h2>Personal Loans:</h2>
    <p>Personal loans are unsecured loans that individuals can use for various personal expenses, such as debt consolidation, home renovations, medical bills, or vacation expenses. Unlike secured loans, personal loans do not require collateral, but they may have higher interest rates as a result. Personal loans typically involve fixed monthly payments over a specified term, making it easier for borrowers to budget and manage their finances.</p>
